# hass-openai-custom-conversation

Conversation support for home assistant using local llm for example vicuna or something else.

This is a fork of https://github.com/drndos/hass-openai-custom-conversation which
has been updated to follow the latest updates from the core repo. The Ollama
integration is preferred, but this is used for exercising lower level use cases
with custom LLMs not supported by Ollama.
